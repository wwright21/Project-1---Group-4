# Project-1---Group-4

We examined the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on success factors for home selling.  We defined success factors as:

1) The time, in days, required to sell the home after its list date (increasing in preference from 0 days, representing a same-day sale, to the maximum number of days a home took to sell from our data set); and
2) The percentage of the original list price received at the time of sale (increasing in preference from the largest percentage below asking price to
the largest percentage above asking price), based on the assumption that people prefer to sell their homes quickly and at prices at or near their asking price.

We collected data from a prominent Real Estate Listing Company.  Access limitations prevented pulling the entire dataset, as well as limited the number of results from queries.  We pulled enough data sets to constitute a sufficient period before, during, and after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, then combined them into one master dataset.  We included all sales during this period.  Characteristics and limitations of the dataset are as follows.  The dataset only considers:
•	Homes that sold, specifically from January 1, 2018 to April 20, 2022
•	Homes that were listed through brokers (only 8% of home sales were FSBO in 2020- National Association of Realtors)
•	Homes specific to one county, in one state of the Southeastern US
•	Data from one aggregation of brokerage services (though we picked the one that was most appropriate to the county we examined) 

We hypothesized how several factors would correlate with a successful home sale before & during Covid-19:
•	School Ratings- Homes in areas with highly rated schools will experience more success than homes in areas with schools that have lower ratings (pre-COVID-19).  
•	Size of the Home- Homes with larger sizes will sell more successfully than homes with smaller sizes (pre-COVID-19).  We expect home size correlation to successful selling to increase during COVID-19    
•	Property Subtype- We hypothesize that (pre-COVID-19) single family homes will sell most successfully relative to other subtypes, mobile homes will be in the middle, and condos will have the lowest correlation to successful selling factors.  Traditional home sales will be positively affected by covid, mobile home sales will have little to no change, and condo sales will be adversely affected.
