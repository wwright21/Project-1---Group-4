# Project-1---Group-4

We examined the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on success factors for home selling.  We defined success factors as:

1) The time, in days, required to sell the home after its list date (increasing in preference from 0 days, representing a same-day sale, to the maximum number of days a home took to sell from our data set); and
2) The percentage of the original list price received at the time of sale (increasing in preference from the largest percentage below asking price to
the largest percentage above asking price), based on the assumption that people prefer to sell their homes quickly and at prices at or near their asking price.

We collected data from a prominent Real Estate Listing Company.  Access limitations prevented pulling the entire dataset, as well as limited the number of results from queries.  We pulled enough data sets to constitute a sufficient period before, during, and after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, then combined them into one master dataset.  We included all sales during this period.  Characteristics and limitations of the dataset are as follows.  The dataset only considers:
•	Homes that sold, specifically from January 1, 2018 to April 20, 2022
•	Homes that were listed through brokers (only 8% of home sales were FSBO in 2020- National Association of Realtors)
•	Homes specific to one county, in one state of the Southeastern US
•	Data from one aggregation of brokerage services (though we picked the one that was most appropriate to the county we examined) 

We hypothesized how several factors would correlate with a successful home sale before & during Covid-19:
•	School Ratings- Homes in areas with highly rated schools will experience more success than homes in areas with schools that have lower ratings (pre-COVID-19).  
•	Size of the Home- Homes with larger sizes will sell more successfully than homes with smaller sizes (pre-COVID-19).  We expect home size correlation to successful selling to increase during COVID-19    
•	Property Subtype- We hypothesized that prior to COVID-19 single family homes sells were most successful relative to other subtypes. Mobile homes would be in the next most successful, and ownhomes/condos would have the lowest correlation to successful selling factors.  During and “post” Covid-19 single family home sales will be positively affected by covid, mobile home sales will have little to no change, and townhomes/condos sales will be adversely affected.

Regarding school ratings, a strong correlation appeared to exist between the two success factors we identified when grouping the data by school. We we trying to understand if homes in highly rated schools tended to sell at or above their list and if they were snatched up quickly by buyers. When plotting the school ratings along the x-axis, we saw a modest effect on days spent on the market for schools with higher ratings. However, this effect did not seem to translate to the other success factor, sales price as a percent of list. Put another way, homes zoned for higher-rated schools generally were purchased more quickly, but not necessarily at or above their listing prices as compared to homes zoned for lower-rated schools. The amount of variance in the data for the 2 success factors also appeared random when plotted against school ratings. Without further statistical analsysis, we cannot confidently reject our null hypothesis (or accept the alternative hypothesis)

•	How was the hypothesis tested in regards to property subtypes?
    •	Using the data available we reviewed the average amount of time each property type stayed on the market for sell over a         span of nearly 5yrs.
    •	We also reviewed the percent of asking price received as a contributing factor.
•	Outcome based on hypothesis.
    •	After these factors were reviewed the results indicated the hypothesis was not correct.
    •	When looking at the percent of asking price as a success factor of each property subtype single-family homes and          townhomes/condos remained steady over the full span of time reviewed, including before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. They both averaged about 100% of the asking price consistently. Mobile home sells on the other hand did have a positive change with  time and appears to get closer to maintaining a higher percent of its listed sells price after Covid-19.
    •	When looking comparing days on the market as a success factor of each subtype townhomes/condos initially appears to have the lowest average time on the market then single-family homes and lastly mobile homes. However, after the covid-19 pandemic struck there is significant decrease in days on market for mobile homes while single family homes and townhomes/condos remained steady.
•	Overall mobile homes had the most success when looking at the change in percent of sells price and days on the market over time especially after the onset Covid-19 pandemic.
